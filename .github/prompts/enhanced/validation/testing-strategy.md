# Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Introduction
This workflow prompt generates comprehensive testing strategies for features based on their specification documents. It automatically creates test cases from EARS acceptance criteria, recommends appropriate testing frameworks, analyzes test data requirements, and identifies coverage gaps to ensure thorough validation of feature implementations.

**Intent**: Create complete, executable testing strategies that validate all requirements and provide confidence in feature quality.

**Context**: Use after specifications are validated and before implementation begins, or to enhance existing testing approaches for complex features.

## Constraints and Guidelines

### Input Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Feature specification directory path containing validated requirements, design, and task documents
- **OPTIONAL**: Project technology stack (language, frameworks, testing tools already in use)
- **OPTIONAL**: Testing scope preference (unit-only, integration-focus, end-to-end-complete, performance-security)
- **OPTIONAL**: Test automation level (manual-only, semi-automated, fully-automated)
- **OPTIONAL**: Existing test suite structure and patterns

### Processing Constraints
1. **EARS-Based Generation**: Generate test cases directly from EARS-formatted acceptance criteria
2. **Technology Alignment**: Recommend testing tools compatible with project technology stack
3. **Coverage Completeness**: Ensure test coverage for all requirements, design components, and implementation tasks
4. **Maintainability Focus**: Design test strategies that remain maintainable as features evolve
5. **Realistic Scope**: Balance comprehensive coverage with practical implementation constraints

### Output Constraints
1. **Executable Format**: Generate test cases in formats ready for implementation (given-when-then, test method templates)
2. **Tool Specificity**: Provide specific framework recommendations with setup instructions
3. **Data Requirements**: Include comprehensive test data specifications and generation strategies
4. **Metrics Definition**: Define measurable success criteria and coverage targets
5. **Automation Strategy**: Provide clear automation roadmap with priority sequencing

## Testing Strategy Generation Process

### Phase 1: Specification Analysis and Test Scope Definition

**Requirements Analysis for Testing:**
1. Parse all EARS-formatted acceptance criteria from requirements.md
2. Extract testable conditions, expected behaviors, and success criteria
3. Identify edge cases, error scenarios, and boundary conditions
4. Categorize requirements by testing complexity and risk level

**Design Component Testing Analysis:**
1. Analyze design.md for architectural components requiring testing
2. Identify interfaces, APIs, data models, and integration points
3. Determine component interaction patterns and dependency testing needs
4. Extract performance, security, and scalability requirements

**Implementation Task Testing Alignment:**
1. Review tasks.md for testing-specific tasks and acceptance criteria
2. Validate testing coverage for all implementation components
3. Identify testing gaps in current task breakdown
4. Recommend additional testing tasks if needed

**Output Requirements:**
- Complete testable requirements inventory with categorization
- Test scope definition matrix (component vs. requirement coverage)
- Risk-based testing priority recommendations
- Gap analysis for testing requirements

### Phase 2: Test Case Generation from EARS Criteria

**Automatic Test Case Creation:**
1. Transform each EARS criterion into structured test cases:
   - WHEN conditions → Test setup and preconditions
   - SHALL behaviors → Expected outcomes and assertions
   - IF-THEN logic → Conditional test scenarios
   - Error conditions → Negative test cases
2. Generate Given-When-Then format test specifications
3. Create test case identifiers linked to requirement references
4. Include both positive and negative test scenarios

**Edge Case and Boundary Testing:**
1. Identify boundary conditions from acceptance criteria
2. Generate edge case tests for input validation, limits, and constraints
3. Create error handling test cases for all identified failure modes
4. Develop stress and load testing scenarios for performance requirements

**Test Data Requirements Analysis:**
1. Extract data requirements from acceptance criteria and design specifications
2. Define test data categories (valid, invalid, boundary, large-scale)
3. Specify data generation strategies and tools
4. Include test data cleanup and management procedures

**Output Requirements:**
- Complete test case catalog with Given-When-Then specifications
- Edge case and boundary testing matrix
- Comprehensive test data requirements specification
- Test case-to-requirement traceability mapping

### Phase 3: Testing Framework and Tool Recommendations

**Technology Stack Analysis:**
1. Analyze project technology stack from specification context
2. Identify existing testing tools and frameworks in use
3. Assess testing tool compatibility and integration requirements
4. Evaluate team expertise and learning curve considerations

**Framework Recommendation Engine:**
1. Recommend unit testing frameworks based on technology stack:
   - JavaScript/TypeScript: Jest, Vitest, Mocha, Jasmine
   - Python: pytest, unittest, nose2
   - Java: JUnit 5, TestNG, Mockito
   - C#: xUnit, NUnit, MSTest
   - Go: testing package, Testify, Ginkgo
2. Suggest integration testing tools and approaches
3. Recommend end-to-end testing frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium)
4. Propose API testing tools (Postman, REST Assured, Supertest)

**Test Infrastructure and Setup:**
1. Provide setup instructions for recommended frameworks
2. Define test environment configuration requirements
3. Recommend CI/CD integration strategies for automated testing
4. Suggest test reporting and metrics collection tools

**Output Requirements:**
- Prioritized testing framework recommendations with justifications
- Complete setup and configuration guides
- Test infrastructure architecture recommendations
- Tool integration and workflow specifications

### Phase 4: Test Coverage Strategy and Gap Analysis

**Coverage Requirement Definition:**
1. Define coverage targets for different test types:
   - Unit test coverage: 80-90% code coverage minimum
   - Integration test coverage: All component interfaces and workflows
   - End-to-end coverage: All user journeys and critical paths
   - API coverage: All endpoints, parameters, and response scenarios
2. Specify functional coverage for all acceptance criteria
3. Define non-functional coverage (performance, security, usability)
4. Establish regression testing coverage for existing functionality

**Gap Analysis and Coverage Validation:**
1. Map test cases to requirements for coverage validation
2. Identify uncovered requirements, components, or scenarios
3. Analyze testing effort vs. risk for coverage gaps
4. Recommend coverage improvement strategies and priorities

**Metrics and Success Criteria:**
1. Define measurable testing success criteria
2. Establish test execution and pass rate targets

### Phase 5: Test Automation Strategy and Implementation Plan

**Automation Priority and Sequencing:**
1. Prioritize test cases for automation based on:
   - Frequency of execution requirements
   - Risk level and business impact
   - Implementation complexity and effort
   - Maintenance overhead considerations

      // When: User submits login form
      const result = await authService.login(credentials);
      const endTime = Date.now();
      
      // Then: System authenticates and responds within 2 seconds
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.user).toBeDefined();
      expect(endTime - startTime).toBeLessThan(2000);

    test('TC_AUTH_002: Should reject invalid credentials', async () => {
      // Given: Invalid credentials
      const credentials = { username: 'test@example.com', password: 'wrongpassword' };
