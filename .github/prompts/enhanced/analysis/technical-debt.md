# Technical Debt Assessment

## Introduction
This workflow prompt performs comprehensive technical debt assessment based on specification complexity, design maintainability, and architectural patterns.

## Technical Debt Assessment Process

### Phase 1: Specification Complexity Analysis and Debt Identification

**Requirements Complexity Assessment:**
