### Failure Scenario Handling
```markdown
**If Individual Prompt Tests Fail:**
1. Review prompt structure and constraint validation
2. Check input data format and completeness
3. Verify EARS format compliance in requirements
4. Validate cross-reference linking mechanisms

**If Integration Tests Fail:**
1. Verify hook configuration syntax and logic
2. Check state management schema compliance
3. Validate context sharing mechanisms
4. Review workflow orchestration sequencing

**If Performance Tests Fail:**
1. Profile memory usage and optimization opportunities
2. Review algorithmic complexity of analysis engines
3. Check for resource bottlenecks in state management
4. Optimize cross-feature dependency resolution

**If Security Tests Fail:**
1. Review access control implementation
2. Verify data sanitization and protection mechanisms
3. Check audit logging completeness and accuracy
4. Validate secure context sharing protocols
```

This comprehensive test execution framework ensures thorough validation of the enhanced RRI Development Prompts system before deployment and provides clear criteria for assessing system readiness.
