```

## Hook Context Sharing Mechanisms

### Context Variables

```yaml
# Available context variables for all enhanced hooks
context_variables:
  feature_id: "extracted_from_file_path"
  feature_count: "total_features_in_project"
  completion_percentage: "calculated_from_tasks"
  security_sensitivity: "detected_from_keywords"
  performance_impact: "detected_from_design_patterns"
  integration_complexity: "calculated_from_dependencies"
```

### Shared State Management

```yaml
# Workflow state tracking across hook executions
state_management:
  validation_status:
    file: ".github/state/validation-status.json"
    schema: "validation_results_per_feature"
  integration_dependencies:
    file: ".github/state/integration-graph.json"
    schema: "feature_dependency_graph"
  analysis_results:
    file: ".github/state/analysis-cache.json"
    schema: "cached_analysis_results"
```

## Advanced Hook Features

### Conditional Logic

```yaml
# Complex conditional triggering
conditions:
  and:
    - file_size_mb: { min: 0.1, max: 10 }
    - or:
        - file_contains: "security"
        - file_path_contains: "auth"
    - not:
        - file_name: "test"
```

### Multi-Stage Workflows

```yaml
# Multi-stage workflow with dependencies
workflow_stages:
  validation:
    hooks: ["spec-validation", "testing-strategy"]
    required: true
  analysis:
    hooks: ["security-analysis", "performance-analysis", "debt-assessment"]
    depends_on: ["validation"]
    parallel: true
  documentation:
    hooks: ["auto-documentation", "retrospective"]
    depends_on: ["analysis"]
    required: false
```

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

```yaml
# Error handling for hook failures
error_handling:
  retry_attempts: 3
  retry_delay: "30s"
  fallback_hooks: ["basic-validation"]
  escalation:
    - notification: "team_lead"
    - create_issue: true
    - priority: "high"
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Install Hooks**: Place hook YAML files in `.github/hooks/` directory
2. **Configure**: Customize conditions and prompts for your project needs
3. **Test**: Use dry-run mode to validate hook behavior before deployment
4. **Monitor**: Check `.github/state/` for workflow status and results
5. **Customize**: Modify hook chains and conditions based on team workflows

## Integration Benefits

- **Automated Quality Gates**: Validation triggered automatically on specification changes
- **Proactive Analysis**: Security and performance analysis before implementation
- **Cross-Feature Coordination**: Automatic detection and resolution of feature conflicts
- **Continuous Documentation**: Up-to-date documentation generated throughout development
- **Process Improvement**: Data-driven retrospectives and workflow optimization

This enhanced hook system transforms the Copilot Agent Development Prompts from a manual workflow into an intelligent, automated development pipeline that scales with your project complexity.
